This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Data

This use to be a site in Jekyll. I change to Next because it is easier to maintain and scale. 

Coming from Jekyll, this site use a lot of markdown files as data entries.

## Dev notes

Remark and RemarkHtml are used to render the markdown files as html.

Styled-components is used for styling.

As said before, this is a Next.js project.

## Scripts

### For development: 

`yarn run dev`

### To build: 

`yarn run build` will run a regular next build.

The site is published in a ftp. For now publishing is done manualy. Before publishing run `yarn run export` and add the files in out folder using a FTP client.

In the near future, I plan to add a github action so publishing is automatic.



## Other stuff

The design of the website was done by me. The copy was also edited so it is more engaging.
