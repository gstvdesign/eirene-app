This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Data

This use to be a site in Jekyll. I change to Next because it is easier to maintain and scale. 

Coming from Jekyll, this site use a lot of markdown files as data entries.

## Dev notes

Remark and RemarkHtml are used to render the markdown files as html.

Styled-components is used for styling.

As said before, this is a Next.js project.

## Scripts

For development: `yarn run dev`

To build: `yarn run build`

## Other stuff

The design of the website was done by me. The copy was also edited so it is more engaging.
